"You don’t learn to swim by reading about water."
```

This repository is an archive of all projects completed during the **42 Piscine**, an intensive bootcamp focused on low-level programming, problem solving, and peer learning. I participated during the **April 2024 Piscine** in **42 Beirut**.

Each directory follows the original subject structure from the Piscine.

* No external libraries
* Norm-compliant code
* Compilable with standard 42 flags

---

## ⚙️ Compilation

Most C exercises:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c
```

Some projects may require specific files or Makefiles depending on the subject.

Shell exercises:

```bash
bash script.sh
```

## 🧠 What This Repository Represents

Instead of listing skills, this repo reflects the core principles learned at 42:

* Writing simple, readable C
* Understanding memory and pointers
* Thinking algorithmically before coding
* Learning by failing, testing, and retrying
* Peer evaluation and collaboration

---

## 🧪 Rules Followed

* Norminette formatting
* No forbidden functions (unless allowed)
* Manual memory management
* Minimal dependencies

---

## ✨ Notes About the Piscine

* Expect trial and error (a lot of it).
* Reading other people’s logic helps more than copying code.
* Small improvements every day make a huge difference by the end, don't be afraid of slow progress.
* I won't say don't use AI, but try your best not to depend on it, doing the exercises yourself will help you more in the long run (and in exams).
* **NUMBER ONE ADVICE:** Don't ever feel shy to ask your peers, this is what 42 is all about!

## 📌 Disclaimer

These exercises are part of the 42 learning process.
If you are currently in the Piscine, **try solving the projects yourself first**.

⚠️ **Some exercises might contain some errors**
